# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Analysis of runtime and memory usage for selected data structures, with working code that sorts and prints a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was tasked with developing an efficient course advising system for ABCU (ABC University). The goal was to give academic advisors a reliable way to load course data from a CSV file, display the full course list in alphanumeric order, and quickly search for individual courses along with their prerequisites. A major part of the challenge was selecting an appropriate data structure that could handle fast searches across hundreds of courses while still keeping the data organized for sorted output. The system also needed to verify that all prerequisite courses were valid before loading the data, helping maintain accuracy and data integrity for advisors using the system to support student planning.
